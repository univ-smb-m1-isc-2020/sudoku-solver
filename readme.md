# sudoku-solver

We would like you to provide us a simple sodoku solver.
 here is the structure to provide the initial grid.
 
```
int[][] board = {
  { 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8 },
  { 0, 0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 },
  { 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0 } 
};
```

it's up to you to 
* create a maven project
* code the structure of a sudoku grid
* code and unit test the rules of a cell groups
* code the interaction and unit test of cells belonging to group
* code a solver algorithm
* configure project for analysis on sonarcloud

good luck :D
